# hangman
Simple alert-based hangman game.

The main flow and design are inspired by the **Javascript for kids** book and placed here just for fun. But! It's fully working game so you're able to play _(even offline)_ i.e. test'n'enjoy ;)

### Gameplay
The game starts with an alert-proposition to enter a word which should be guessed later by the other person. Then the game itself is processed in a guided way. You have only 3 attempts to guess the correct letters!

_**P.S.** Some logs typed in the console._
